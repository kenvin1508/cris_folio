const introduction = `Hello, I‚Äôm Cris, from Vietnam, and you‚Äôre probably wondering: "Why is there a Mads Mikkelsen look-alike here?" Haha, I love this character because he‚Äôs smart and cool, and, fun fact, almost everyone I know in Web3 sees me through that persona. Let me share a little bit about myself. Although I spent my first two years studying at a medical school, life took me down a different path, and I decided to switch gears and pursue something I‚Äôm passionate about. I later graduated with a degree in Economics from one of the top universities in Vietnam, where I not only deepened my knowledge of economics but also had the chance to study law. This multidisciplinary foundation helped me develop strong analytical thinking and effective communication skills. My real-world experiences, both in work and life, have taught me how to blend theory and practice to achieve the best results. Plus, my proficiency in English has opened up opportunities to access international information and networks, enhancing my career value. 

2020 marked a pivotal turning point in my career when I ventured into the world of cryptocurrency. At that time, I accidentally got involved with PancakeSwap on BSC Chain and Uniswap on ETH, and received my first airdrop rewards, which completely blew me away. Initially, I saw it as just an investment opportunity, but as I delved deeper, I realized the limitless potential of this technology. My growing passion pushed me to explore further, and I came to understand that I could do more than just be a user, investing in coins and receiving airdrops, I could actively contribute to the development of projects.

I began to craft a plan for deeper involvement in this space and decided to become a key player in the community, adding value not just as a participant, but as a project builder. Starting from scratch, I quickly learned and honed the skills necessary to become a valuable Moderator, contributing to the growth and engagement of the community. After spending a significant amount of time in the role of Moderator, I now feel confident and ready to take the next step in my journey, with the goal of becoming a Community Manager, a role I believe will allow me to make meaningful changes and provide lasting contributions to the project‚Äôs development.`;
